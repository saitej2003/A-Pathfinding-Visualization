# A-Pathfinding-Visualization

This self-initiated project showcases my expertise in implementing the A* search algorithm to find the most optimal path on a grid-based map. The project features an intuitive user interface and real-time visualization, allowing users to witness the algorithm's progress step-by-step. By providing a hands-on experience, this project demonstrates my problem-solving skills and passion for creating interactive applications.

## Features

* A Pathfinding Algorithm: Efficient implementation of the A* search algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
* Real-Time Visualization: Users can observe the algorithm's progress in real-time on a grid-based map.
* Intuitive User Interface: Easy-to-use interface for setting start and end points, as well as obstacles on the map.
* Step-by-Step Execution: The algorithm's execution is broken down into steps, providing insights into its decision-making process.

## Usage
* Setting Start and End Points:  Click on the grid to set the starting point.
Click again to set the destination point.
* Adding Obstacles:  Click and drag to add obstacles on the grid.
* Running the Algorithm:  Press the "Run" button to initiate the A* pathfinding algorithm.
* Reset:  Use the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start anew.
